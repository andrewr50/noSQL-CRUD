# noSQL-CRUD

## Description

This a noSQL CRUD api for social network databases. This was built to provide basic back end functions to a social media site. Models and routes are included for Users, Thoughts, and Reactions to Thoughts. While there are sure to be more specific routes that are needed this is a good skeleton to start with. I became more comfortable with mongoose and noSQL database structure.

## Installation

First we need to install our dependencies. We will start by entering `npm i` into the terminal. Once the dependencies are installed we will start the server with `npm start`.

## Usage

There is no front end to this application. Use insomnia to test the routes.

The below video is a walkthrough of how to use Insomnia with the routes:
